This repository contains all supplementary materials associated with the master’s thesis “AI-Driven Interview-Based Process Discovery: A Conversational Agent for Eliciting Process Knowledge and Generating Process Models.” 
The repository provides the full artefact implementation and supporting research materials to ensure transparency, reproducibility, and extensibility of the presented work. Specifically, it includes (1) the source code of the developed prototype, including agent configurations and transformation logic, (2) evaluation data sets, ground-truth models, generated models, and computed evaluation results, and (3) the complete data basis for the systematic literature review, including screening results. The materials allow researchers and practitioners to reproduce the evaluation, analyse the artefact design, and build upon the proposed LLM-driven interview-based process discovery framework.
